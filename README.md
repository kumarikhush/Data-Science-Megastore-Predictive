# Data-Science-Megastore-Predictive
MegaStore Project:

> Import all the libaries which we need.
> Data Inspection-

  -Check the ratio of null values.
  -Check how many categorical and numerical values is there in data.
  -Check the outliers using Box-Plot graph.
  -If missimg values is their, we can input the missing values with "Means".
  -If missing vaues is their in categorical columns, we can input the missing values with "Mode".
  -If there is different column with same data(let's fix the irregularities).
  -Determine the year of operation of a store.
  -Create a board category of type of item.
  -Modify categories.
  -Check the outliers,and treat it with maximum.
  -Visualize some data.
  -check VIF for all features.
  -As most of them are categorical column,we need to go for other statistical test.
  -apply One Hot Encoding.
  -Transform our target.
